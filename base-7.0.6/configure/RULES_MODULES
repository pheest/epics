# Support modules can use these rules to build submodules too.
#
# The requirements to do so are:
#    1. Create a file CONFIG_SITE.local in the same directory as the
#       Makefile, which defines these variables (the last one is empty):
#           PARENT_MODULE - The name submodules call their parent
#           INSTALL_LOCATION := $($(PARENT_MODULE))
#           CONFIG_INSTALLS =
#    2. The Makefile must set TOP and include $(TOP)/configure/CONFIG and
#       CONFIG_SITE.local
#    3. Submodules are added to the SUBMODULES variable in the Makefile
#    4. Dependencies between submodules must be set using
#           <name>_DEPEND_DIRS = <prerequisites>
#    5. The Makefile must end by including $(TOP)/configure/RULES_MODULES
#    6. Submodules must have a configure/RELEASE file that contains
#           -include $(TOP)/../RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).local
#    7. Submodules must have a configure/CONFIG_SITE file that contains
#           -include $(TOP)/../CONFIG_SITE.local

# Add checked-out submodules to DIRS
DIRS += $(subst /Makefile,,$(wildcard $(addsuffix /Makefile, $(SUBMODULES))))

include $(CONFIG)/RULES_DIRS
